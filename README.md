Goober is an e-commerce developed by me, in order to learn hands-on about REST API, fetch caching, and how to deal with images in the backend and frontend in general.

For the development of my REST API I used Java + Sprint, with routes protected by a JWT token, I used redis to cache repeated requests, a PostegreSQL database to store the data, and a MongoDB database to store the backup of images

And for the frontend I used typescript + Next.js to build the pages, the shadcn UI lib for beautiful components, and tailwind

I learned a lot from this project even though there is a lot to improve on it, and I intend to continue evolving it over time!
